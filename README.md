# Game Lab 🎮

A playground repository for experimenting with game ideas, mechanics, and small prototypes.

## Goals

- Rapidly prototype small games
- Reuse a shared **engine/core** where possible
- Keep assets organized and easy to reuse
- Practice clean code, version control, and documentation

## Tech Stack

- Language: _e.g. TypeScript / C# / Python / C++_
- Engine / Framework: _e.g. Unity / Godot / Phaser / Pygame_
- Tools:
  - Git + GitHub for version control
  - _Add build tools, package managers, etc._
